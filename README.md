# Azure-Policy-CIS
## Purpose
- Implement Azure policies in order to enforce the [Center for Internet Security guidelines for Azure](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/ "CIS Link").

## Current Status
- Sections 1,2,3, and 9 are complete and validated. If you do not see a Policy for a control then that means that at this time it cannot be done via policy.
- Sections 4-8 are mostly done, but are undergoing final testing. Once testing of existing policies is complete I will make a final pass through these sections to assess if any additional controls can be handled via policy.

## Disclaimer
**This project is a work in progress, policies are to be taken on an 'as-is' basis. No garuntees are made, and it is understood that it is the users responsibilty to perform verification and testing.**
