# Azure-Policy-CIS
## Purpose
- Implement Azure policies in order to enforce the [Center for Internet Security guidelines for Azure](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/ "CIS Link").

## Current Status
- All sections are complete and validated. If you do not see a Policy for a control then that means that at this time it cannot be done via policy or that there is a Built-in Policy for that control.

## Disclaimer
**This project is a work in progress, policies are to be taken on an 'as-is' basis. No garuntees are made, and it is understood that it is the users responsibilty to perform verification and testing.**
